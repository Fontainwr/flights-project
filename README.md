# flights-project Airline Reviews App - Rails and React CRUD Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Airline Reviews App! This is a project that demonstrates how to build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Ruby on Rails and React.js. Throughout this video series, we will create a web application for airline reviews, allowing users to share their experiences with different airlines.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- Ruby on Rails
- React.js
- Webpacker
- Fast_jsonapi (for API development)
- styled-components (for front-end styling)
- react-router (for routing)
- Axios (for API requests)

## Video Series

### Video 1: Back-End Setup
In the first video of this series, we will focus on building the back-end functionality of our application. This includes setting up the models, controllers, routes, and serializers from scratch. By the end of this video, we'll have a functional Rails API for handling airline reviews.

### Video 2: Front-End Development
In the second video, we will start building the front-end portion of our app using React.js. We'll use Webpacker to integrate React into our Rails application. This video will cover components, styling with styled-components, routing with react-router, and making API requests with Axios.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/airline-reviews-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd airline-reviews-app`
3. Install Ruby gems: `bundle install`
4. Install Node.js packages: `yarn install`
5. Set up the database: `rails db:create db:migrate`
